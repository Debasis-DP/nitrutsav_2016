				<h3>Hospitality</h3>
				<div>
					<ul class="modal-custom-body" style="overflow-y:scroll;">
From its humble beginnings in 2005, Nitrutsav has evolved to be one of the largest cultural fests in Eastern India, today. Being the hosts of such an event, we, the organizing committee of Nitrutsav ‘17 have always strived to leave no stone unturned in providing comfort, care and a safe haven to each of its off-campus participants during their stay at NITR. We realize that, at the end of a hectic day of travel, moving around from here to there, a warm bed and homely delicious food is all that one requires. Hospitality management, therefore, is one of our top priorities this year. 
For a successful completion of the event, we would require you to be refreshed, rejuvenated, and geared up for the wide assortment of events that INNOVISION has to offer. Our aim this year is to assure you of top-notch accommodation facilities and a varied and mixed bag of flavours to satiate every taste bud on campus. Should you require any information at any point of time, a team will always be ready to respond to your queries, details of which shall be provided to you. We would also try our level best to provide you with all the necessary conveniences at your very disposal, so that you do not face any real issues. 

However, all said and done, there are a few etiquettes that all the participants are expected to follow at all times: 
						<li>Students carrying laptops or other high-end gadgets, are required to keep the same with their own selves at all times. NITR shall not be responsible for any losses.</li>
						<li>Students are requested to maintain decorum and not to indulge in any activity that might harm the peace of the event.</li>
						<li>While we shall be providing you with beds, furniture and mattresses, you are required to carry a bed sheet and other necessary things that you might require. Carrying a blanket would also be encouraged, as it might be a little cold during the event.</li>
						<li>All the participants must carry a valid Student ID Card to produce during the registration.</li>
						<li>Participants are requested to abide by the rules of each event, as informed to them.</li>
						
We sincerely hope, that you make the most of Nitrutsav 2017, and that your stay here is something that you take back with you to cherish for days to come. We extend you, a hearty welcome from the entire fraternity.
